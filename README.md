# op-recipes

Description:
This is my first HTML wesbite/project following the curriculum on The Odin Project.
My goal is to make a very rudimentary simple website that links to various recipe pages.
I am to cover the basic skills of HTML, which are:
  - Setting up the default boilerplate
  - Using basic tags, such as paragraphs, headings, images, etc.
  - Being able to link to pages and/or images as need be.
This project also is a learning experience in using GIT and version control, learning how to make commits and keep track of a project in a repository.
