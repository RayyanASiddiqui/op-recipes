# op-recipes

## Description:
This is my first HTML wesbite/project following the curriculum on The Odin Project.
My goal is to make a very rudimentary simple website that links to various recipe pages.
This project also is a learning experience in using GIT and version control, learning how to make commits and keep track of a project in a repository.

## I am to cover the basic skills of HTML, which are:
  - Setting up the default boilerplate
  - Using basic tags, such as paragraphs, headings, images, etc.
  - Being able to link to pages and/or images as need be.

## Post-project thoughts
This was a really fun thing to build. What I enjoyed most was being able to use the terminal and git funcitonality properly, which has been something I've wanted to do for a while but struggled to understand on my own. This project also gave me a good understanding of managing files and locations, as well as how to organize a website. I recognize I could've made a separate folder for images now, but it isn't too big a concern. Overall, great introductory learning experience and I look forward to wahtever I have to learn and build next in this course.
