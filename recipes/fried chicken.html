        <p>
        Fried chicken is chicken that has been coated in seasoned flour or batter and then deep-fried or pan-fried. 
        It's a popular dish with various regional variations, each with its own unique seasoning and preparation methods. 
        The coating adds a crispy crust to the chicken while the inside remains juicy.
